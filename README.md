# CSE 3100 - Systems Programming Labs

This repository contains my lab assignments for **CSE 3100: Systems Programming** at the **University of Connecticut**.  
Each lab focuses on developing C programming and systems-level skills such as process control, file I/O, memory management, data structures, and concurrency.

## 🧠 Course Overview
**CSE 3100** emphasizes programming in C and using system calls and libraries provided by the UNIX operating system.  
Topics covered include:
- Pointers and dynamic memory allocation
- File input/output and system calls
- Structs and linked lists
- Hash tables
- Process creation and synchronization
- Threads and concurrency
- Makefiles and modular programming
